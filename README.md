# Ai-Pose-Estimation-And-Curl-Tracker
Developed an AI-powered gym workout tracker using MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time pose estimation, repetition counting, and calorie estimation. Provides instant feedback on form, improving workout efficiency and injury prevention. Ideal for fitness enthusiasts and athletes, with future plans for voice feedback and multi-exercise tracking.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Pose Estimation: Uses MediaPipe to track keypoints (shoulders, elbows, wrists) for accurate movement detection.

Repetition Counter: Analyzes arm motion and only counts valid reps, reducing errors from improper form.

Real-Time Feedback: Provides instant corrections to maintain proper workout posture.

Calorie Estimation: Uses MET values to estimate calories burned based on movement and duration.

Performance Tracking: Helps users improve efficiency by analyzing workout trends.


ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

Many gym-goers struggle with tracking reps accurately and maintaining correct posture. This AI-based system automates form analysis, ensuring reliable and real-time feedback for better workouts. It is particularly beneficial for fitness enthusiasts, athletes, and physical therapy patients.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

Python â€“ Core AI and logic implementation.

OpenCV & MediaPipe â€“ Pose estimation and motion tracking.

Flask â€“ Backend for potential web-based access.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ UI for interactive experience.

NumPy â€“ Mathematical calculations for analysis.


ðŸ“Š Experimental Results:

Lighting Conditions: 100% accuracy in good lighting, 50% in dim settings.

Posture Accuracy: Correct postures detected with 100% accuracy, but incorrect ones were not well recognized.

Speed Sensitivity: Higher accuracy at slower speeds (90% at 3 reps/sec); drops to 50% at 10 reps/sec.

Distance from Camera: Maintains 100% accuracy regardless of user position.


ðŸš€ Future Enhancements:

Expanding to full-body exercise tracking.

Adding voice-guided real-time feedback.

AI-powered custom workout recommendations.

Integration with wearable fitness devices.


This AI-powered gym assistant automates workout tracking, making fitness smarter, safer, and more effective. Contributions and feedback are welcome! ðŸ’ª
